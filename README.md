# word_at_a_time

`word_at_a_time is a simple C utility that helps you pull words from a string, one at a time. This header file includes a straightforward function that lets you extract words from a source string and put them into a buffer. Itâ€™s perfect for when you need to handle text efficiently, processing it word by word as you go.


## Features

- **Extract Words**: Retrieve one word at a time from the source string.
- **Static Pointer Management**: Maintain the current position in the source string across multiple calls.
- **Flexible Input**: Initialize with a new source string or continue parsing from the previous position.

## Function

### `int word_at_a_time(char *src, char *buf)`

#### Description

This function extracts the next word from the `src` string and copies it to `buf`. 

- **Parameters**:
  - `src`: A pointer to the source string. If `src` is `NULL`, the function will continue from the last position set by a previous call.
  - `buf`: A pointer to the buffer where the extracted word will be stored.

- **Returns**:
  - `0` if a word was successfully extracted and copied to `buf`.
  - `-1` if there are no more words to extract or if `src` is `NULL` and no previous source was set.

#### Behavior

- If `src` is not `NULL`, it updates the internal pointer to start extracting from this new source.
- Skips any leading spaces in the source string.
- Copies characters from the source to the buffer until it encounters a space or the end of the string.
- Null-terminates the buffer after the word.

## Example Usage

```c
#include "word_at_a_time.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (void)
{
	char *str = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, "
		"sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. "
		"Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris "
		"nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in "
		"reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla "
		"pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa "
		"qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.";
	char buf[50];

	// 
	if (!word_at_a_time(str, buf))
		printf("%s | ", buf);
	else
		return EXIT_FAILURE;
	
	while (!word_at_a_time(0, buf))
		printf("%s | ", buf);
	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
